# SMS-and-Email-Spam-Detection

This project uses machine learning to classify text messages and emails as either **spam** or **ham** (not spam). It explores natural language processing (NLP) workflows and applies various models to detect unwanted messages effectively.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `SMS_and_Email_Spam_Detection.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features

- Text cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**
- Classification using:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
  - Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-Score
- Confusion matrix visualization

## 📦 Dependencies

Install required Python packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk



📊 Dataset
The dataset contains labeled messages categorized as:

ham: legitimate messages
spam: unwanted messages

You may download similar datasets from the UCI ML Repository.

🧠 Model Performance
Multiple models are trained and evaluated. Metrics such as F1-score and confusion matrix help determine the best-performing model.
